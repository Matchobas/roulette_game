This is an app to create a online Wheel of Fortune, with it you are able to add your own options with each one with their own weighs and then spin the wheel and see who wins.

You can access the server side for this application <a href="https://github.com/matheus-alexandria/wheel_of_fortune_server">here</a>.

To run this you have to clone this repositorie and run this command in terminal:
```
yarn dev
```

To run some of the features you will need to set up the <a href='https://github.com/matheus-alexandria/wheel_of_fortune_server'>backend</a> as well!

Within the app you're also able to:
<ul>
  <li>Delete all options at once</li>
  <li>Shuffle the current options (not yet changing them on demand inside the wheel)</li>
  <li>Export your options in a .csv file, to save a group of options that you want to use again later.</li>
  <li>Also you can use a .csv file generated by the app or a personal one to load a group of custom options.</li>
</ul>

<span>What to do next:</span>
<ul>
  <li>Add a method to change the base colors of the wheel</li>
  <li>Add sounds to the wheel spinning and for the winner</li>
</ul>
