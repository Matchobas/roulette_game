This is an app to create a online Wheel of Fortune, with it you are able to add your own options with each one with their own weighs and then spin the wheel and see who wins.

You can access this application <a href="https://github.com/matheus-alexandria/wheel_of_fortune_server">here</a>.

If you want to run this in your computer you have to install the dependencies with:
```
yarn
```
and then run:
```
yarn dev
```

To run some of the features you will need to set up the <a href='https://github.com/matheus-alexandria/wheel_of_fortune_server'>backend</a> as well!

As for now the server is not online, so to access the backend functionalities you must install the backend.

The intention with this application is to practice my skill and eventually integrate it with Twitch.
